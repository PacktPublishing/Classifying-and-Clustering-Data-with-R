# Classifying and Clustering Data with R [Video]
This is the code repository for [Classifying and Clustering Data with R [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/classifying-and-clustering-data-r-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788294904), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this second volume of this course, we will provide steps for carrying out classification and clustering with R/RStudio software. We build up on the first volume where visualization and regression-based models were covered to provide methods for carrying out more advanced analysis using R/RStudio. The approaches are illustrated using practical applications.

By the end of this course you should be able to carry out cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, time series analysis and decision tree analysis using R/RStudio
